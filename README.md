    <img src="Images/Flow of the Program.png" class="center">

    Flight Data Initialization:
    User inputs cities and preferred travel details in a Google Sheet.

    IATA Code Lookup:
    The script fetches IATA codes via Sheety and stores them in the sheet.

    Price Check:
    The Amadeus API is used to fetch flight prices and availability.

    Alert Trigger:
    If a price falls below a set threshold, the system:

        Sends an SMS via Twilio

        Sends an email with flight details

    Logging and Monitoring:
    All interactions and changes are logged for user behavior analysis and optimization.

📈 Benefits

    Automates tedious flight searches

    Reduces human error in tracking best deals

    Saves users money with early-bird alerts

    Reduces manual work by 80% through automation
